Did you mean "base"?

    Valid properties:
        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        base
            Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
            units). In "stack" or "relative" barmode, traces that
            set "base" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode
            instead.
        basesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `base`.
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
            subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
        constraintext
            Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
            be no larger than the bar itself.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

            dict with compatible properties
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Hoverlabel` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. variables `value` and `label`. Anything
            contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the
            secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        insidetextanchor
            Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
            points in `textposition` "inside" mode.
        insidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items.
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Marker` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        offset
            Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
            axis units). In "group" barmode, traces that set
            "offset" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode
            instead.
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        offsetsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `offset`.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Sets the orientation of the bars. With "v" ("h"), the
            value of the each bar spans along the vertical
            (horizontal).
        outsidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
        selected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Selected` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the font used for `text`.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
            "none", no text appears.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `textposition`.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. variables `value` and `label`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        width
            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
        widthsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `width`.
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.

Did you mean "layer"?

    Valid properties:
        anchor
            If set to an opposite-letter axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`),
            this axis is bound to the corresponding opposite-letter
            axis. If set to "free", this axis' position is
            determined by `position`.
        automargin
            Determines whether long tick labels automatically grow
            the figure margins.
        autorange
            Determines whether or not the range of this axis is
            computed in relation to the input data. See `rangemode`
            for more info. If `range` is provided, then `autorange`
            is set to False.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. Defaults to
            layout.autotypenumbers.
        calendar
            Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and `tick0`
            if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar
            for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in
            the trace or via the global `layout.calendar`
        categoryarray
            Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to
            "array". Used with `categoryorder`.
        categoryarraysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `categoryarray`.
        categoryorder
            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of
            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses "trace",
            which specifies the order that is present in the data
            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*
            or *category descending* if order should be determined
            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set
            `categoryorder` to "array" to derive the ordering from
            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not
            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting
            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the
            "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will follow
            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`
            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order
            should be determined by the numerical order of the
            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the
            min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.
        color
            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis
            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid
            color is lightened by blending this with the plot
            background Individual pieces can override this.
        constrain
            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its
            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the
            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing
            the "range", or by decreasing the "domain". Default is
            "domain" for axes containing image traces, "range"
            otherwise.
        constraintoward
            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its
            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the
            other axis), determines which direction we push the
            originally specified plot area. Options are "left",
            "center" (default), and "right" for x axes, and "top",
            "middle" (default), and "bottom" for y axes.
        dividercolor
            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on
            "multicategory" axes.
        dividerwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an
            effect on "multicategory" axes.
        domain
            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).
        dtick
            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with
            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings
            available to "log" and "date" axes. If the axis `type`
            is "log", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n
            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at
            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks
            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks
            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to
            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log" has several special
            values; "L<f>", where `f` is a positive number, gives
            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For
            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus
            small digits between, use "D1" (all digits) or "D2"
            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for "D1" and "D2".
            If the axis `type` is "date", then you must convert the
            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.
            "date" also has special values "M<n>" gives ticks
            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive
            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,
            set `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To set
            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
        exponentformat
            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.
            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If
            "none", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If
            "E", 1E+9. If "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super
            script). If "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
        fixedrange
            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If
            true, then zoom is disabled.
        gridcolor
            Sets the color of the grid lines.
        griddash
            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string
            ("solid", "dot", "dash", "longdash", "dashdot", or
            "longdashdot") or a dash length list in px (eg
            "5px,10px,2px,2px").
        gridwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
        hoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display "09~15~23.46"
        layer
            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If
            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the
            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is
            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the
            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like
            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers
            and/or text nodes above this axis.
        linecolor
            Sets the axis line color.
        linewidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
        matches
            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range
            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding
            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes
            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram
            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in
            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is
            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes
            must have the same `type`.
        minexponent
            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.
            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is "SI" or
            "B".
        minor
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        mirror
            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored
            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the
            axis lines are mirrored. If "ticks", the axis lines and
            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If
            "all", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes
            subplots. If "allticks", axis lines and ticks are
            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.
        nticks
            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be
            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to
            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to
            "auto".
        overlaying
            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on
            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces
            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis
            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,
            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-
            numbered axis will be visible.
        position
            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space
            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if
            `anchor` is set to "free".
        range
            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is
            "log", then you must take the log of your desired range
            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range
            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is "date", it should
            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects
            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to
            strings. If the axis `type` is "category", it should be
            numbers, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        rangebreaks
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        rangebreakdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets
            the default property values to use for elements of
            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks
        rangemode
            If "normal", the range is computed in relation to the
            extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`, the range
            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If
            "nonnegative", the range is non-negative, regardless of
            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.
        rangeselector
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        rangeslider
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        scaleanchor
            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range
            of this axis changes together with the range of the
            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per
            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still
            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom
            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`
            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the
            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:
            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you
            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis
            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect
            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across
            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:
            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the
            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid
            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.
            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a
            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently
            forbidden.
        scaleratio
            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,
            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For
            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this
            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on
            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an
            elevation profile where the vertical scale is
            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the
            horizontal.
        separatethousands
            If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
        showdividers
            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between
            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on
            "multicategory" axes.
        showexponent
            If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
            significands. If "first", only the exponent of the
            first tick is shown. If "last", only the exponent of
            the last tick is shown. If "none", no exponents appear.
        showgrid
            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If
            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.
        showline
            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is
            drawn.
        showspikes
            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are
            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when
            hovermode = closest
        showticklabels
            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.
        showtickprefix
            If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.
            If "first", only the first tick is displayed with a
            prefix. If "last", only the last tick is displayed with
            a suffix. If "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
        showticksuffix
            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
        side
            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the
            "bottom" ("left") or "top" ("right") of the plotting
            area.
        spikecolor
            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series
            color
        spikedash
            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string
            ("solid", "dot", "dash", "longdash", "dashdot", or
            "longdashdot") or a dash length list in px (eg
            "5px,10px,2px,2px").
        spikemode
            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If
            "toaxis", the line is drawn from the data point to the
            axis the  series is plotted on. If "across", the line
            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes
            "toaxis". If "marker", then a marker dot is drawn on
            the axis the series is plotted on
        spikesnap
            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor
            or to the closest datapoints.
        spikethickness
            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.
        tick0
            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use
            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is "log", then you
            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set
            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except
            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the
            axis `type` is "date", it should be a date string, like
            date data. If the axis `type` is "category", it should
            be a number, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        tickangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the
            tick labels vertically.
        tickcolor
            Sets the tick color.
        tickfont
            Sets the tick font.
        tickformat
            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display "09~15~23.46"
        tickformatstops
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti
            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible
            properties
        tickformatstopdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),
            sets the default property values to use for elements of
            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops
        ticklabelmode
            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to
            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an
            effect for axes of `type` "date" When set to "period",
            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period
            between ticks.
        ticklabeloverflow
            Determines how we handle tick labels that would
            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the
            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide
            past domain*. Otherwise on "category" and
            "multicategory" axes the default is "allow". In other
            cases the default is *hide past div*.
        ticklabelposition
            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to
            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect
            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to "period".
            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when
            `ticklabelmode` is set to "period". Has no effect on
            "multicategory" axes or when `tickson` is set to
            "boundaries". When used on axes linked by `matches` or
            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would
            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.
        ticklabelstep
            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the
            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means
            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every
            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick
            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.
            Not implemented for axes with `type` "log" or
            "multicategory", or when `tickmode` is "array".
        ticklen
            Sets the tick length (in px).
        tickmode
            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto", the number
            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If "linear", the
            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting
            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` ("linear" is
            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).
            If "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. ("array" is
            the default value if `tickvals` is provided).
        tickprefix
            Sets a tick label prefix.
        ticks
            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If "", this
            axis' ticks are not drawn. If "outside" ("inside"),
            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.
        tickson
            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with
            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an
            effect for axes of `type` "category" or
            "multicategory". When set to "boundaries", ticks and
            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom
            of labels.
        ticksuffix
            Sets a tick label suffix.
        ticktext
            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via
            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to
            "array". Used with `tickvals`.
        ticktextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ticktext`.
        tickvals
            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to "array".
            Used with `ticktext`.
        tickvalssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `tickvals`.
        tickwidth
            Sets the tick width (in px).
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.xaxis.title.font instead.
            Sets this axis' title font. Note that the title's font
            used to be customized by the now deprecated `titlefont`
            attribute.
        type
            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to
            determined the axis type by looking into the data of
            the traces that referenced the axis in question.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis
            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:
            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        visible
            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving
            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a
            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false
        zeroline
            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the
            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn
            on top of the grid lines.
        zerolinecolor
            Sets the line color of the zero line.
        zerolinewidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.

    Valid properties:
        activeshape
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Activeshape`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        annotations
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        annotationdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.annotations
        autosize
            Determines whether or not a layout width or height that
            has been left undefined by the user is initialized on
            each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute,
            an undefined layout width or height is always
            initialized on the first call to plot.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. This is the default
            value; however it could be overridden for individual
            axes.
        bargap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        bargroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        barmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "relative", the bars
            are stacked on top of one another, with negative values
            below the axis, positive values above With "group", the
            bars are plotted next to one another centered around
            the shared location. With "overlay", the bars are
            plotted over one another, you might need to an
            "opacity" to see multiple bars.
        barnorm
            Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph.
            With "fraction", the value of each bar is divided by
            the sum of all values at that location coordinate.
            "percent" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show
            percentages.
        boxgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        boxgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        boxmode
            Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the boxes are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the boxes are plotted over one
            another, you might need to set "opacity" to see them
            multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have
            "width" set.
        calendar
            Sets the default calendar system to use for
            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.
        clickmode
            Determines the mode of single click interactions.
            "event" is the default value and emits the
            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the
            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes "lasso" and
            "select", but with no event data attached (kept for
            compatibility reasons). The "select" flag enables
            selecting single data points via click. This mode also
            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing
            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an
            existing selection. "select" with `hovermode`: "x" can
            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
            "closest" when using this feature. Selection events are
            sent accordingly as long as "event" flag is set as
            well. When the "event" flag is missing, `plotly_click`
            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.
        coloraxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        colorway
            Sets the default trace colors.
        computed
            Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting values
            namely `margin.t`, `margin.b`, `margin.l` and
            `margin.r` in "full-json" mode.
        datarevision
            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that
            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can
            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete
            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being
            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a
            different identity from its predecessor contains new
            data.
        dragmode
            Determines the mode of drag interactions. "select" and
            "lasso" apply only to scatter traces with markers or
            text. "orbit" and "turntable" apply only to 3D scenes.
        editrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names
            and axis titles. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        extendfunnelareacolors
            If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether given
            by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
            will be extended to three times its original length by
            first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color
            20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood
            of reusing the same color when you have many slices,
            but you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in
            the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendiciclecolors
            If `true`, the icicle slice colors (whether given by
            `iciclecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendpiecolors
            If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given by
            `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendsunburstcolors
            If `true`, the sunburst slice colors (whether given by
            `sunburstcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will
            be extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendtreemapcolors
            If `true`, the treemap slice colors (whether given by
            `treemapcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        font
            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces
            and other layout components inherit from the global
            font.
        funnelareacolorway
            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to
            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you
            specify a new list here it can still be extended with
            lighter and darker colors, see
            `extendfunnelareacolors`.
        funnelgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        funnelgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        funnelmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "group", the bars
            are plotted next to one another centered around the
            shared location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted
            over one another, you might need to an "opacity" to see
            multiple bars.
        geo
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Geo` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        grid
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Grid` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        height
            Sets the plot's height (in px).
        hiddenlabels
            hiddenlabels is the funnelarea & pie chart analog of
            visible:'legendonly' but it can contain many labels,
            and can simultaneously hide slices from several
            pies/funnelarea charts
        hiddenlabelssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hiddenlabels`.
        hidesources
            Determines whether or not a text link citing the data
            source is placed at the bottom-right cored of the
            figure. Has only an effect only on graphs that have
            been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio
            Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-
            premise).
        hoverdistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). This is only a real distance for
            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.
            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)
            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but
            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like
            objects in case of conflict.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovermode
            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
            "closest", a single hoverlabel will appear for the
            "closest" point within the `hoverdistance`. If "x" (or
            "y"), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple
            points at the "closest" x- (or y-) coordinate within
            the `hoverdistance`, with the caveat that no more than
            one hoverlabel will appear per trace. If *x unified*
            (or *y unified*), a single hoverlabel will appear
            multiple points at the closest x- (or y-) coordinate
            within the `hoverdistance` with the caveat that no more
            than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this
            mode, spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular
            to the specified axis. If false, hover interactions are
            disabled.
        iciclecolorway
            Sets the default icicle slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendiciclecolors`.
        images
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Image`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        imagedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.imagedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.images
        legend
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Legend` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        mapbox
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Mapbox` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        margin
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in
            various `text` attributes. Attributes such as the
            graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation
            `text` `trace.name` in legend items, `rangeselector`,
            `updatemenus` and `sliders` `label` text all support
            `meta`. One can access `meta` fields using template
            strings: `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
            `meta` item in question. `meta` can also be an object
            for example `{key: value}` which can be accessed
            %{meta[key]}.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        modebar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Modebar` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        newshape
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Newshape` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        paper_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the paper where the graph
            is drawn.
        piecolorway
            Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to the main
            `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a new
            list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendpiecolors`.
        plot_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the plotting area in-
            between x and y axes.
        polar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Polar` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        scene
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Scene` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectdirection
            When `dragmode` is set to "select", this limits the
            selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or
            diagonal. "h" only allows horizontal selection, "v"
            only vertical, "d" only diagonal and "any" sets no
            limit.
        selectionrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected
            points from all traces.
        separators
            Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example,
            *. * puts a '.' before decimals and a space between
            thousands. In English locales, dflt is ".," but other
            locales may alter this default.
        shapes
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Shape`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        shapedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.shapedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.shapes
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is
            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)
            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the
            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One
            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
        sliders
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        sliderdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.sliders
        smith
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Smith` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        spikedistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does
            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some
            objects can be hovered on but will not generate
            spikelines, such as scatter fills.
        sunburstcolorway
            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
        template
            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This
            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':
            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,
            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching
            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is
            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type
            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may
            be specified as an instance of
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are
            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container
            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An
            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)
            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a
            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array
            for an item with matching `name` and apply that
            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the
            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced
            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be
            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for
            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make
            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:
            false`.
        ternary
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets
            the title font. Note that the title's font used to be
            customized by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
        transition
            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react
            updates.
        treemapcolorway
            Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendtreemapcolors`.
        uirevision
            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to
            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of
            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if
            it is given and it changed from the previous
            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If
            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any
            attribute that has been affected by user interactions
            and did not receive a different value in the new figure
            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`
            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`
            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control
            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,
            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y
            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is
            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`
            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range
            will retain any user-driven zoom.
        uniformtext
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Uniformtext`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        updatemenus
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        updatemenudefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.updatemenus
        violingap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        violingroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        violinmode
            Determines how violins at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the violins are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the violins are plotted over
            one another, you might need to set "opacity" to see
            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        waterfallgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        waterfallgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        waterfallmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "group", the bars are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted over one
            another, you might need to an "opacity" to see multiple
            bars.
        width
            Sets the plot's width (in px).
        xaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.XAxis` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        yaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.YAxis` instance or

    Valid properties:
        activeshape
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Activeshape`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        annotations
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        annotationdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.annotations
        autosize
            Determines whether or not a layout width or height that
            has been left undefined by the user is initialized on
            each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute,
            an undefined layout width or height is always
            initialized on the first call to plot.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. This is the default
            value; however it could be overridden for individual
            axes.
        bargap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        bargroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        barmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "relative", the bars
            are stacked on top of one another, with negative values
            below the axis, positive values above With "group", the
            bars are plotted next to one another centered around
            the shared location. With "overlay", the bars are
            plotted over one another, you might need to an
            "opacity" to see multiple bars.
        barnorm
            Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph.
            With "fraction", the value of each bar is divided by
            the sum of all values at that location coordinate.
            "percent" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show
            percentages.
        boxgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        boxgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        boxmode
            Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the boxes are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the boxes are plotted over one
            another, you might need to set "opacity" to see them
            multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have
            "width" set.
        calendar
            Sets the default calendar system to use for
            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.
        clickmode
            Determines the mode of single click interactions.
            "event" is the default value and emits the
            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the
            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes "lasso" and
            "select", but with no event data attached (kept for
            compatibility reasons). The "select" flag enables
            selecting single data points via click. This mode also
            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing
            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an
            existing selection. "select" with `hovermode`: "x" can
            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
            "closest" when using this feature. Selection events are
            sent accordingly as long as "event" flag is set as
            well. When the "event" flag is missing, `plotly_click`
            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.
        coloraxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        colorway
            Sets the default trace colors.
        computed
            Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting values
            namely `margin.t`, `margin.b`, `margin.l` and
            `margin.r` in "full-json" mode.
        datarevision
            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that
            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can
            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete
            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being
            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a
            different identity from its predecessor contains new
            data.
        dragmode
            Determines the mode of drag interactions. "select" and
            "lasso" apply only to scatter traces with markers or
            text. "orbit" and "turntable" apply only to 3D scenes.
        editrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names
            and axis titles. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        extendfunnelareacolors
            If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether given
            by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
            will be extended to three times its original length by
            first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color
            20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood
            of reusing the same color when you have many slices,
            but you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in
            the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendiciclecolors
            If `true`, the icicle slice colors (whether given by
            `iciclecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendpiecolors
            If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given by
            `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendsunburstcolors
            If `true`, the sunburst slice colors (whether given by
            `sunburstcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will
            be extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendtreemapcolors
            If `true`, the treemap slice colors (whether given by
            `treemapcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        font
            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces
            and other layout components inherit from the global
            font.
        funnelareacolorway
            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to
            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you
            specify a new list here it can still be extended with
            lighter and darker colors, see
            `extendfunnelareacolors`.
        funnelgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        funnelgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        funnelmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "group", the bars
            are plotted next to one another centered around the
            shared location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted
            over one another, you might need to an "opacity" to see
            multiple bars.
        geo
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Geo` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        grid
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Grid` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        height
            Sets the plot's height (in px).
        hiddenlabels
            hiddenlabels is the funnelarea & pie chart analog of
            visible:'legendonly' but it can contain many labels,
            and can simultaneously hide slices from several
            pies/funnelarea charts
        hiddenlabelssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hiddenlabels`.
        hidesources
            Determines whether or not a text link citing the data
            source is placed at the bottom-right cored of the
            figure. Has only an effect only on graphs that have
            been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio
            Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-
            premise).
        hoverdistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). This is only a real distance for
            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.
            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)
            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but
            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like
            objects in case of conflict.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovermode
            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
            "closest", a single hoverlabel will appear for the
            "closest" point within the `hoverdistance`. If "x" (or
            "y"), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple
            points at the "closest" x- (or y-) coordinate within
            the `hoverdistance`, with the caveat that no more than
            one hoverlabel will appear per trace. If *x unified*
            (or *y unified*), a single hoverlabel will appear
            multiple points at the closest x- (or y-) coordinate
            within the `hoverdistance` with the caveat that no more
            than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this
            mode, spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular
            to the specified axis. If false, hover interactions are
            disabled.
        iciclecolorway
            Sets the default icicle slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendiciclecolors`.
        images
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Image`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        imagedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.imagedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.images
        legend
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Legend` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        mapbox
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Mapbox` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        margin
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in
            various `text` attributes. Attributes such as the
            graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation
            `text` `trace.name` in legend items, `rangeselector`,
            `updatemenus` and `sliders` `label` text all support
            `meta`. One can access `meta` fields using template
            strings: `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
            `meta` item in question. `meta` can also be an object
            for example `{key: value}` which can be accessed
            %{meta[key]}.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        modebar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Modebar` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        newshape
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Newshape` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        paper_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the paper where the graph
            is drawn.
        piecolorway
            Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to the main
            `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a new
            list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendpiecolors`.
        plot_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the plotting area in-
            between x and y axes.
        polar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Polar` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        scene
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Scene` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectdirection
            When `dragmode` is set to "select", this limits the
            selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or
            diagonal. "h" only allows horizontal selection, "v"
            only vertical, "d" only diagonal and "any" sets no
            limit.
        selectionrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected
            points from all traces.
        separators
            Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example,
            *. * puts a '.' before decimals and a space between
            thousands. In English locales, dflt is ".," but other
            locales may alter this default.
        shapes
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Shape`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        shapedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.shapedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.shapes
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is
            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)
            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the
            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One
            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
        sliders
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        sliderdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.sliders
        smith
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Smith` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        spikedistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does
            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some
            objects can be hovered on but will not generate
            spikelines, such as scatter fills.
        sunburstcolorway
            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
        template
            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This
            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':
            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,
            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching
            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is
            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type
            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may
            be specified as an instance of
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are
            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container
            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An
            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)
            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a
            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array
            for an item with matching `name` and apply that
            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the
            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced
            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be
            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for
            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make
            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:
            false`.
        ternary
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets
            the title font. Note that the title's font used to be
            customized by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
        transition
            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react
            updates.
        treemapcolorway
            Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendtreemapcolors`.
        uirevision
            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to
            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of
            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if
            it is given and it changed from the previous
            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If
            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any
            attribute that has been affected by user interactions
            and did not receive a different value in the new figure
            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`
            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`
            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control
            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,
            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y
            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is
            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`
            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range
            will retain any user-driven zoom.
        uniformtext
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Uniformtext`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        updatemenus
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        updatemenudefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.updatemenus
        violingap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        violingroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        violinmode
            Determines how violins at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the violins are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the violins are plotted over
            one another, you might need to set "opacity" to see
            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        waterfallgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        waterfallgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        waterfallmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "group", the bars are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted over one
            another, you might need to an "opacity" to see multiple
            bars.
        width
            Sets the plot's width (in px).
        xaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.XAxis` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        yaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.YAxis` instance or
            dict with compatible properties

Did you mean "color"?

    Valid properties:
        anchor
            If set to an opposite-letter axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`),
            this axis is bound to the corresponding opposite-letter
            axis. If set to "free", this axis' position is
            determined by `position`.
        automargin
            Determines whether long tick labels automatically grow
            the figure margins.
        autorange
            Determines whether or not the range of this axis is
            computed in relation to the input data. See `rangemode`
            for more info. If `range` is provided, then `autorange`
            is set to False.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. Defaults to
            layout.autotypenumbers.
        calendar
            Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and `tick0`
            if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar
            for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in
            the trace or via the global `layout.calendar`
        categoryarray
            Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to
            "array". Used with `categoryorder`.
        categoryarraysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `categoryarray`.
        categoryorder
            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of
            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses "trace",
            which specifies the order that is present in the data
            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*
            or *category descending* if order should be determined
            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set
            `categoryorder` to "array" to derive the ordering from
            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not
            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting
            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the
            "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will follow
            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`
            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order
            should be determined by the numerical order of the
            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the
            min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.
        color
            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis
            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid
            color is lightened by blending this with the plot
            background Individual pieces can override this.
        constrain
            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its
            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the
            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing
            the "range", or by decreasing the "domain". Default is
            "domain" for axes containing image traces, "range"
            otherwise.
        constraintoward
            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its
            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the
            other axis), determines which direction we push the
            originally specified plot area. Options are "left",
            "center" (default), and "right" for x axes, and "top",
            "middle" (default), and "bottom" for y axes.
        dividercolor
            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on
            "multicategory" axes.
        dividerwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an
            effect on "multicategory" axes.
        domain
            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).
        dtick
            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with
            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings
            available to "log" and "date" axes. If the axis `type`
            is "log", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n
            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at
            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks
            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks
            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to
            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log" has several special
            values; "L<f>", where `f` is a positive number, gives
            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For
            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus
            small digits between, use "D1" (all digits) or "D2"
            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for "D1" and "D2".
            If the axis `type` is "date", then you must convert the
            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.
            "date" also has special values "M<n>" gives ticks
            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive
            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,
            set `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To set
            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
        exponentformat
            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.
            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If
            "none", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If
            "E", 1E+9. If "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super
            script). If "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
        fixedrange
            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If
            true, then zoom is disabled.
        gridcolor
            Sets the color of the grid lines.
        griddash
            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string
            ("solid", "dot", "dash", "longdash", "dashdot", or
            "longdashdot") or a dash length list in px (eg
            "5px,10px,2px,2px").
        gridwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
        hoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display "09~15~23.46"
        layer
            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If
            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the
            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is
            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the
            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like
            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers
            and/or text nodes above this axis.
        linecolor
            Sets the axis line color.
        linewidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
        matches
            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range
            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding
            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes
            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram
            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in
            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is
            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes
            must have the same `type`.
        minexponent
            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.
            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is "SI" or
            "B".
        minor
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        mirror
            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored
            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the
            axis lines are mirrored. If "ticks", the axis lines and
            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If
            "all", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes
            subplots. If "allticks", axis lines and ticks are
            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.
        nticks
            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be
            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to
            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to
            "auto".
        overlaying
            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on
            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces
            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis
            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,
            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-
            numbered axis will be visible.
        position
            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space
            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if
            `anchor` is set to "free".
        range
            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is
            "log", then you must take the log of your desired range
            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range
            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is "date", it should
            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects
            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to
            strings. If the axis `type` is "category", it should be
            numbers, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        rangebreaks
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        rangebreakdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets
            the default property values to use for elements of
            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks
        rangemode
            If "normal", the range is computed in relation to the
            extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`, the range
            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If
            "nonnegative", the range is non-negative, regardless of
            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.
        rangeselector
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        rangeslider
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        scaleanchor
            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range
            of this axis changes together with the range of the
            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per
            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still
            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom
            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`
            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the
            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:
            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you
            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis
            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect
            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across
            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:
            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the
            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid
            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.
            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a
            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently
            forbidden.
        scaleratio
            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,
            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For
            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this
            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on
            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an
            elevation profile where the vertical scale is
            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the
            horizontal.
        separatethousands
            If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
        showdividers
            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between
            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on
            "multicategory" axes.
        showexponent
            If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
            significands. If "first", only the exponent of the
            first tick is shown. If "last", only the exponent of
            the last tick is shown. If "none", no exponents appear.
        showgrid
            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If
            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.
        showline
            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is
            drawn.
        showspikes
            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are
            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when
            hovermode = closest
        showticklabels
            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.
        showtickprefix
            If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.
            If "first", only the first tick is displayed with a
            prefix. If "last", only the last tick is displayed with
            a suffix. If "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
        showticksuffix
            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
        side
            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the
            "bottom" ("left") or "top" ("right") of the plotting
            area.
        spikecolor
            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series
            color
        spikedash
            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string
            ("solid", "dot", "dash", "longdash", "dashdot", or
            "longdashdot") or a dash length list in px (eg
            "5px,10px,2px,2px").
        spikemode
            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If
            "toaxis", the line is drawn from the data point to the
            axis the  series is plotted on. If "across", the line
            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes
            "toaxis". If "marker", then a marker dot is drawn on
            the axis the series is plotted on
        spikesnap
            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor
            or to the closest datapoints.
        spikethickness
            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.
        tick0
            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use
            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is "log", then you
            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set
            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except
            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the
            axis `type` is "date", it should be a date string, like
            date data. If the axis `type` is "category", it should
            be a number, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        tickangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the
            tick labels vertically.
        tickcolor
            Sets the tick color.
        tickfont
            Sets the tick font.
        tickformat
            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display "09~15~23.46"
        tickformatstops
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti
            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible
            properties
        tickformatstopdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),
            sets the default property values to use for elements of
            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops
        ticklabelmode
            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to
            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an
            effect for axes of `type` "date" When set to "period",
            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period
            between ticks.
        ticklabeloverflow
            Determines how we handle tick labels that would
            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the
            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide
            past domain*. Otherwise on "category" and
            "multicategory" axes the default is "allow". In other
            cases the default is *hide past div*.
        ticklabelposition
            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to
            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect
            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to "period".
            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when
            `ticklabelmode` is set to "period". Has no effect on
            "multicategory" axes or when `tickson` is set to
            "boundaries". When used on axes linked by `matches` or
            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would
            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.
        ticklabelstep
            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the
            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means
            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every
            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick
            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.
            Not implemented for axes with `type` "log" or
            "multicategory", or when `tickmode` is "array".
        ticklen
            Sets the tick length (in px).
        tickmode
            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto", the number
            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If "linear", the
            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting
            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` ("linear" is
            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).
            If "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. ("array" is
            the default value if `tickvals` is provided).
        tickprefix
            Sets a tick label prefix.
        ticks
            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If "", this
            axis' ticks are not drawn. If "outside" ("inside"),
            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.
        tickson
            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with
            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an
            effect for axes of `type` "category" or
            "multicategory". When set to "boundaries", ticks and
            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom
            of labels.
        ticksuffix
            Sets a tick label suffix.
        ticktext
            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via
            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to
            "array". Used with `tickvals`.
        ticktextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ticktext`.
        tickvals
            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to "array".
            Used with `ticktext`.
        tickvalssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `tickvals`.
        tickwidth
            Sets the tick width (in px).
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.xaxis.title.font instead.
            Sets this axis' title font. Note that the title's font
            used to be customized by the now deprecated `titlefont`
            attribute.
        type
            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to
            determined the axis type by looking into the data of
            the traces that referenced the axis in question.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis
            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:
            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        visible
            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving
            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a
            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false
        zeroline
            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the
            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn
            on top of the grid lines.
        zerolinecolor
            Sets the line color of the zero line.
        zerolinewidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.

            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        annotationdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.annotations
        autosize
            Determines whether or not a layout width or height that
            has been left undefined by the user is initialized on
            each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute,
            an undefined layout width or height is always
            initialized on the first call to plot.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. This is the default
            value; however it could be overridden for individual
            axes.
        bargap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        bargroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        barmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "relative", the bars
            are stacked on top of one another, with negative values
            below the axis, positive values above With "group", the
            bars are plotted next to one another centered around
            the shared location. With "overlay", the bars are
            plotted over one another, you might need to an
            "opacity" to see multiple bars.
        barnorm
            Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph.
            With "fraction", the value of each bar is divided by
            the sum of all values at that location coordinate.
            "percent" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show
            percentages.
        boxgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        boxgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        boxmode
            Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the boxes are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the boxes are plotted over one
            another, you might need to set "opacity" to see them
            multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have
            "width" set.
        calendar
            Sets the default calendar system to use for
            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.
        clickmode
            Determines the mode of single click interactions.
            "event" is the default value and emits the
            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the
            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes "lasso" and
            "select", but with no event data attached (kept for
            compatibility reasons). The "select" flag enables
            selecting single data points via click. This mode also
            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing
            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an
            existing selection. "select" with `hovermode`: "x" can
            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
            "closest" when using this feature. Selection events are
            sent accordingly as long as "event" flag is set as
            well. When the "event" flag is missing, `plotly_click`
            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.
        coloraxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        colorway
            Sets the default trace colors.
        computed
            Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting values
            namely `margin.t`, `margin.b`, `margin.l` and
            `margin.r` in "full-json" mode.
        datarevision
            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that
            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can
            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete
            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being
            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a
            different identity from its predecessor contains new
            data.
        dragmode
            Determines the mode of drag interactions. "select" and
            "lasso" apply only to scatter traces with markers or
            text. "orbit" and "turntable" apply only to 3D scenes.
        editrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names
            and axis titles. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        extendfunnelareacolors
            If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether given
            by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
            will be extended to three times its original length by
            first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color
            20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood
            of reusing the same color when you have many slices,
            but you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in
            the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendiciclecolors
            If `true`, the icicle slice colors (whether given by
            `iciclecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendpiecolors
            If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given by
            `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendsunburstcolors
            If `true`, the sunburst slice colors (whether given by
            `sunburstcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will
            be extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendtreemapcolors
            If `true`, the treemap slice colors (whether given by
            `treemapcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        font
            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces
            and other layout components inherit from the global
            font.
        funnelareacolorway
            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to
            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you
            specify a new list here it can still be extended with
            lighter and darker colors, see
            `extendfunnelareacolors`.
        funnelgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        funnelgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        funnelmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "group", the bars
            are plotted next to one another centered around the
            shared location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted
            over one another, you might need to an "opacity" to see
            multiple bars.
        geo
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Geo` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        grid
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Grid` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        height
            Sets the plot's height (in px).
        hiddenlabels
            hiddenlabels is the funnelarea & pie chart analog of
            visible:'legendonly' but it can contain many labels,
            and can simultaneously hide slices from several
            pies/funnelarea charts
        hiddenlabelssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hiddenlabels`.
        hidesources
            Determines whether or not a text link citing the data
            source is placed at the bottom-right cored of the
            figure. Has only an effect only on graphs that have
            been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio
            Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-
            premise).
        hoverdistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). This is only a real distance for
            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.
            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)
            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but
            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like
            objects in case of conflict.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovermode
            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
            "closest", a single hoverlabel will appear for the
            "closest" point within the `hoverdistance`. If "x" (or
            "y"), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple
            points at the "closest" x- (or y-) coordinate within
            the `hoverdistance`, with the caveat that no more than
            one hoverlabel will appear per trace. If *x unified*
            (or *y unified*), a single hoverlabel will appear
            multiple points at the closest x- (or y-) coordinate
            within the `hoverdistance` with the caveat that no more
            than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this
            mode, spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular
            to the specified axis. If false, hover interactions are
            disabled.
        iciclecolorway
            Sets the default icicle slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendiciclecolors`.
        images
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Image`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        imagedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.imagedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.images
        legend
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Legend` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        mapbox
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Mapbox` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        margin
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in
            various `text` attributes. Attributes such as the
            graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation
            `text` `trace.name` in legend items, `rangeselector`,
            `updatemenus` and `sliders` `label` text all support
            `meta`. One can access `meta` fields using template
            strings: `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
            `meta` item in question. `meta` can also be an object
            for example `{key: value}` which can be accessed
            %{meta[key]}.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        modebar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Modebar` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        newshape
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Newshape` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        paper_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the paper where the graph
            is drawn.
        piecolorway
            Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to the main
            `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a new
            list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendpiecolors`.
        plot_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the plotting area in-
            between x and y axes.
        polar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Polar` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        scene
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Scene` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectdirection
            When `dragmode` is set to "select", this limits the
            selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or
            diagonal. "h" only allows horizontal selection, "v"
            only vertical, "d" only diagonal and "any" sets no
            limit.
        selectionrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected
            points from all traces.
        separators
            Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example,
            *. * puts a '.' before decimals and a space between
            thousands. In English locales, dflt is ".," but other
            locales may alter this default.
        shapes
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Shape`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        shapedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.shapedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.shapes
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is
            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)
            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the
            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One
            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
        sliders
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        sliderdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.sliders
        smith
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Smith` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        spikedistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does
            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some
            objects can be hovered on but will not generate
            spikelines, such as scatter fills.
        sunburstcolorway
            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
        template
            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This
            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':
            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,
            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching
            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is
            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type
            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may
            be specified as an instance of
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are
            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container
            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An
            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)
            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a
            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array
            for an item with matching `name` and apply that
            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the
            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced
            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be
            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for
            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make
            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:
            false`.
        ternary
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets
            the title font. Note that the title's font used to be
            customized by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
        transition
            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react
            updates.
        treemapcolorway
            Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendtreemapcolors`.
        uirevision
            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to
            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of
            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if
            it is given and it changed from the previous
            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If
            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any
            attribute that has been affected by user interactions
            and did not receive a different value in the new figure
            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`
            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`
            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control
            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,
            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y
            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is
            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`
            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range
            will retain any user-driven zoom.

            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.updatemenus
        violingap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        violingroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        violinmode
            Determines how violins at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the violins are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the violins are plotted over
            one another, you might need to set "opacity" to see
            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        waterfallgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        waterfallgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        waterfallmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "group", the bars are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted over one
            another, you might need to an "opacity" to see multiple
            bars.
        width
            Sets the plot's width (in px).

            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Annotation`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        annotationdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.annotations
        autosize
            Determines whether or not a layout width or height that
            has been left undefined by the user is initialized on
            each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute,
            an undefined layout width or height is always
            initialized on the first call to plot.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. This is the default
            value; however it could be overridden for individual
            axes.
        bargap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        bargroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        barmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "relative", the bars
            are stacked on top of one another, with negative values
            below the axis, positive values above With "group", the
            bars are plotted next to one another centered around
            the shared location. With "overlay", the bars are
            plotted over one another, you might need to an
            "opacity" to see multiple bars.
        barnorm
            Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph.
            With "fraction", the value of each bar is divided by
            the sum of all values at that location coordinate.
            "percent" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show
            percentages.
        boxgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        boxgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        boxmode
            Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the boxes are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the boxes are plotted over one
            another, you might need to set "opacity" to see them
            multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have
            "width" set.
        calendar
            Sets the default calendar system to use for
            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.
        clickmode
            Determines the mode of single click interactions.
            "event" is the default value and emits the
            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the
            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes "lasso" and
            "select", but with no event data attached (kept for
            compatibility reasons). The "select" flag enables
            selecting single data points via click. This mode also
            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing
            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an
            existing selection. "select" with `hovermode`: "x" can
            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
            "closest" when using this feature. Selection events are
            sent accordingly as long as "event" flag is set as
            well. When the "event" flag is missing, `plotly_click`
            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.
        coloraxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        colorway
            Sets the default trace colors.
        computed
            Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting values
            namely `margin.t`, `margin.b`, `margin.l` and
            `margin.r` in "full-json" mode.
        datarevision
            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that
            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can
            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete
            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being
            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a
            different identity from its predecessor contains new
            data.
        dragmode
            Determines the mode of drag interactions. "select" and
            "lasso" apply only to scatter traces with markers or
            text. "orbit" and "turntable" apply only to 3D scenes.
        editrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names
            and axis titles. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        extendfunnelareacolors
            If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether given
            by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
            will be extended to three times its original length by
            first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color
            20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood
            of reusing the same color when you have many slices,
            but you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in
            the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendiciclecolors
            If `true`, the icicle slice colors (whether given by
            `iciclecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendpiecolors
            If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given by
            `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendsunburstcolors
            If `true`, the sunburst slice colors (whether given by
            `sunburstcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will
            be extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendtreemapcolors
            If `true`, the treemap slice colors (whether given by
            `treemapcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        font
            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces
            and other layout components inherit from the global
            font.
        funnelareacolorway
            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to
            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you
            specify a new list here it can still be extended with
            lighter and darker colors, see
            `extendfunnelareacolors`.
        funnelgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        funnelgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        funnelmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "group", the bars
            are plotted next to one another centered around the
            shared location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted
            over one another, you might need to an "opacity" to see
            multiple bars.
        geo
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Geo` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        grid
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Grid` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        height
            Sets the plot's height (in px).
        hiddenlabels
            hiddenlabels is the funnelarea & pie chart analog of
            visible:'legendonly' but it can contain many labels,
            and can simultaneously hide slices from several
            pies/funnelarea charts
        hiddenlabelssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hiddenlabels`.
        hidesources
            Determines whether or not a text link citing the data
            source is placed at the bottom-right cored of the
            figure. Has only an effect only on graphs that have
            been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio
            Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-
            premise).
        hoverdistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). This is only a real distance for
            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.
            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)
            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but
            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like
            objects in case of conflict.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovermode
            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
            "closest", a single hoverlabel will appear for the
            "closest" point within the `hoverdistance`. If "x" (or
            "y"), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple
            points at the "closest" x- (or y-) coordinate within
            the `hoverdistance`, with the caveat that no more than
            one hoverlabel will appear per trace. If *x unified*
            (or *y unified*), a single hoverlabel will appear
            multiple points at the closest x- (or y-) coordinate
            within the `hoverdistance` with the caveat that no more
            than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this
            mode, spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular
            to the specified axis. If false, hover interactions are
            disabled.
        iciclecolorway
            Sets the default icicle slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendiciclecolors`.

            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in
            various `text` attributes. Attributes such as the
            graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation
            `text` `trace.name` in legend items, `rangeselector`,
            `updatemenus` and `sliders` `label` text all support
            `meta`. One can access `meta` fields using template
            strings: `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
            `meta` item in question. `meta` can also be an object
            for example `{key: value}` which can be accessed
            %{meta[key]}.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.

        paper_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the paper where the graph
            is drawn.
        piecolorway
            Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to the main
            `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a new
            list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendpiecolors`.
        plot_bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the plotting area in-
            between x and y axes.
        polar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Polar` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        scene
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Scene` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        selectdirection
            When `dragmode` is set to "select", this limits the
            selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or
            diagonal. "h" only allows horizontal selection, "v"
            only vertical, "d" only diagonal and "any" sets no
            limit.
        selectionrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected
            points from all traces.
        separators
            Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example,
            *. * puts a '.' before decimals and a space between
            thousands. In English locales, dflt is ".," but other
            locales may alter this default.
        shapes
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Shape`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        shapedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.shapedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.shapes
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is
            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)
            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the
            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One
            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
        sliders
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        sliderdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.sliders
        smith
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Smith` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        spikedistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does
            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some
            objects can be hovered on but will not generate
            spikelines, such as scatter fills.
        sunburstcolorway
            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
        template
            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This
            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':
            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,
            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching
            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is
            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type
            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may
            be specified as an instance of
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are
            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container
            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An
            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)
            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a
            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array
            for an item with matching `name` and apply that
            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the
            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced
            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be
            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for
            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make
            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:
            false`.
        ternary
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets
            the title font. Note that the title's font used to be
            customized by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
        transition
            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react
            updates.
        treemapcolorway
            Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendtreemapcolors`.
        uirevision
            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to
            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of
            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if
            it is given and it changed from the previous
            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If
            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any
            attribute that has been affected by user interactions
            and did not receive a different value in the new figure
            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`
            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`
            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control
            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,
            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y
            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is
            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`
            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range
            will retain any user-driven zoom.
        uniformtext
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Uniformtext`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        updatemenus
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        updatemenudefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.updatemenus
        violingap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        violingroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        violinmode
            Determines how violins at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the violins are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the violins are plotted over
            one another, you might need to set "opacity" to see
            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        waterfallgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        waterfallgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        waterfallmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "group", the bars are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted over one
            another, you might need to an "opacity" to see multiple
            bars.
        width
            Sets the plot's width (in px).
        xaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.XAxis` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        yaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.YAxis` instance or

Did you mean "side"?

    Valid properties:
        anchor
            If set to an opposite-letter axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`),
            this axis is bound to the corresponding opposite-letter
            axis. If set to "free", this axis' position is
            determined by `position`.
        automargin
            Determines whether long tick labels automatically grow
            the figure margins.
        autorange
            Determines whether or not the range of this axis is
            computed in relation to the input data. See `rangemode`
            for more info. If `range` is provided, then `autorange`
            is set to False.
        autotypenumbers
            Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data is not
            converted to a number. Using *convert types* a numeric
            string in trace data may be treated as a number during
            automatic axis `type` detection. Defaults to
            layout.autotypenumbers.
        calendar
            Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and `tick0`
            if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar
            for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in
            the trace or via the global `layout.calendar`
        categoryarray
            Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `categoryorder` is set to
            "array". Used with `categoryorder`.
        categoryarraysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `categoryarray`.
        categoryorder
            Specifies the ordering logic for the case of
            categorical variables. By default, plotly uses "trace",
            which specifies the order that is present in the data
            supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending*
            or *category descending* if order should be determined
            by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set
            `categoryorder` to "array" to derive the ordering from
            the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not
            found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting
            behavior for that attribute will be identical to the
            "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will follow
            the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder`
            to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order
            should be determined by the numerical order of the
            values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the
            min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.
        color
            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis
            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid
            color is lightened by blending this with the plot
            background Individual pieces can override this.
        constrain
            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its
            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the
            other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing
            the "range", or by decreasing the "domain". Default is
            "domain" for axes containing image traces, "range"
            otherwise.
        constraintoward
            If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its
            own `scaleanchor` and `scaleratio` or those of the
            other axis), determines which direction we push the
            originally specified plot area. Options are "left",
            "center" (default), and "right" for x axes, and "top",
            "middle" (default), and "bottom" for y axes.
        dividercolor
            Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on
            "multicategory" axes.
        dividerwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an
            effect on "multicategory" axes.
        domain
            Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction).
        dtick
            Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with
            `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings
            available to "log" and "date" axes. If the axis `type`
            is "log", then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n
            is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at
            1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks
            at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks
            at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to
            log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log" has several special
            values; "L<f>", where `f` is a positive number, gives
            ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For
            example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
            at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus
            small digits between, use "D1" (all digits) or "D2"
            (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for "D1" and "D2".
            If the axis `type` is "date", then you must convert the
            time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
            between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0.
            "date" also has special values "M<n>" gives ticks
            spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive
            integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month,
            set `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To set
            ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
        exponentformat
            Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents.
            For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If
            "none", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If
            "E", 1E+9. If "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super
            script). If "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
        fixedrange
            Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If
            true, then zoom is disabled.
        gridcolor
            Sets the color of the grid lines.
        griddash
            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string
            ("solid", "dot", "dash", "longdash", "dashdot", or
            "longdashdot") or a dash length list in px (eg
            "5px,10px,2px,2px").
        gridwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
        hoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display "09~15~23.46"
        layer
            Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If
            *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the
            subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is
            displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the
            grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like
            traces with `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers
            and/or text nodes above this axis.
        linecolor
            Sets the axis line color.
        linewidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
        matches
            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range
            of this axis will match the range of the corresponding
            axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes
            share auto-range values, category lists and histogram
            auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in
            both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is
            currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes
            must have the same `type`.
        minexponent
            Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number.
            This only has an effect when `tickformat` is "SI" or
            "B".
        minor
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Minor`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        mirror
            Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored
            to the opposite side of the plotting area. If True, the
            axis lines are mirrored. If "ticks", the axis lines and
            ticks are mirrored. If False, mirroring is disable. If
            "all", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes
            subplots. If "allticks", axis lines and ticks are
            mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.
        nticks
            Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
            particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be
            chosen automatically to be less than or equal to
            `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to
            "auto".
        overlaying
            If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on
            top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces
            and axes visible for both axes. If False, this axis
            does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case,
            for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-
            numbered axis will be visible.
        position
            Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space
            (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if
            `anchor` is set to "free".
        range
            Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is
            "log", then you must take the log of your desired range
            (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range
            from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is "date", it should
            be date strings, like date data, though Date objects
            and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to
            strings. If the axis `type` is "category", it should be
            numbers, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        rangebreaks
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangebreak`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        rangebreakdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.xaxis.rangebreakdefaults), sets
            the default property values to use for elements of
            layout.xaxis.rangebreaks
        rangemode
            If "normal", the range is computed in relation to the
            extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`, the range
            extends to 0, regardless of the input data If
            "nonnegative", the range is non-negative, regardless of
            the input data. Applies only to linear axes.
        rangeselector
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeselector
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        rangeslider
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Rangeslider`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        scaleanchor
            If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range
            of this axis changes together with the range of the
            corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per
            unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still
            zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom
            the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain`
            and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the
            constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis:
            {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you
            can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis
            can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect
            ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across
            subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis:
            {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the
            last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid
            possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`.
            Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a
            `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently
            forbidden.
        scaleratio
            If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`,
            this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For
            example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this
            axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on
            the linked axis. Use this for example to create an
            elevation profile where the vertical scale is
            exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the
            horizontal.
        separatethousands
            If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
        showdividers
            Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between
            the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on
            "multicategory" axes.
        showexponent
            If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
            significands. If "first", only the exponent of the
            first tick is shown. If "last", only the exponent of
            the last tick is shown. If "none", no exponents appear.
        showgrid
            Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If
            True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.
        showline
            Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is
            drawn.
        showspikes
            Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are
            drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when
            hovermode = closest
        showticklabels
            Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.
        showtickprefix
            If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix.
            If "first", only the first tick is displayed with a
            prefix. If "last", only the last tick is displayed with
            a suffix. If "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
        showticksuffix
            Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
        side
            Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the
            "bottom" ("left") or "top" ("right") of the plotting
            area.
        spikecolor
            Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series
            color
        spikedash
            Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string
            ("solid", "dot", "dash", "longdash", "dashdot", or
            "longdashdot") or a dash length list in px (eg
            "5px,10px,2px,2px").
        spikemode
            Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If
            "toaxis", the line is drawn from the data point to the
            axis the  series is plotted on. If "across", the line
            is drawn across the entire plot area, and supercedes
            "toaxis". If "marker", then a marker dot is drawn on
            the axis the series is plotted on
        spikesnap
            Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor
            or to the closest datapoints.
        spikethickness
            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.
        tick0
            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use
            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is "log", then you
            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set
            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except
            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the
            axis `type` is "date", it should be a date string, like
            date data. If the axis `type` is "category", it should
            be a number, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        tickangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the
            tick labels vertically.
        tickcolor
            Sets the tick color.
        tickfont
            Sets the tick font.
        tickformat
            Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display "09~15~23.46"
        tickformatstops
            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Ti
            ckformatstop` instances or dicts with compatible
            properties
        tickformatstopdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.xaxis.tickformatstopdefaults),
            sets the default property values to use for elements of
            layout.xaxis.tickformatstops
        ticklabelmode
            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to
            their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an
            effect for axes of `type` "date" When set to "period",
            tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period
            between ticks.
        ticklabeloverflow
            Determines how we handle tick labels that would
            overflow either the graph div or the domain of the
            axis. The default value for inside tick labels is *hide
            past domain*. Otherwise on "category" and
            "multicategory" axes the default is "allow". In other
            cases the default is *hide past div*.
        ticklabelposition
            Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to
            the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect
            on x axes or when `ticklabelmode` is set to "period".
            Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when
            `ticklabelmode` is set to "period". Has no effect on
            "multicategory" axes or when `tickson` is set to
            "boundaries". When used on axes linked by `matches` or
            `scaleanchor`, no extra padding for inside labels would
            be added by autorange, so that the scales could match.
        ticklabelstep
            Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the
            spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means
            each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every
            2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick
            is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown.
            Not implemented for axes with `type` "log" or
            "multicategory", or when `tickmode` is "array".
        ticklen
            Sets the tick length (in px).
        tickmode
            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto", the number
            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If "linear", the
            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting
            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` ("linear" is
            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).
            If "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. ("array" is
            the default value if `tickvals` is provided).
        tickprefix
            Sets a tick label prefix.
        ticks
            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If "", this
            axis' ticks are not drawn. If "outside" ("inside"),
            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.
        tickson
            Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with
            respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an
            effect for axes of `type` "category" or
            "multicategory". When set to "boundaries", ticks and
            grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom
            of labels.
        ticksuffix
            Sets a tick label suffix.
        ticktext
            Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via
            `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to
            "array". Used with `tickvals`.
        ticktextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ticktext`.
        tickvals
            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to "array".
            Used with `ticktext`.
        tickvalssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `tickvals`.
        tickwidth
            Sets the tick width (in px).
        title
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.xaxis.Title`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.xaxis.title.font instead.
            Sets this axis' title font. Note that the title's font
            used to be customized by the now deprecated `titlefont`
            attribute.
        type
            Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to
            determined the axis type by looking into the data of
            the traces that referenced the axis in question.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis
            `range`, `autorange`, and `title` if in `editable:
            true` configuration. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        visible
            A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving
            interaction like dragging. Default is true when a
            cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false
        zeroline
            Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the
            0 value of this axis. If True, the zero line is drawn
            on top of the grid lines.
        zerolinecolor
            Sets the line color of the zero line.
        zerolinewidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the zero line.
